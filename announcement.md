# The Protocol on GitHub

The Public  Life Data Protocol has been an endeavor for the public good, for all to use, since its inception. For the past two years, [Gehl Institute](https://gehlinstitute.org) has worked with [Gehl](https://gehlpeople.com), San Francisco Planning, Seattle Department of Transportation, and the Municipality of Copenhagen to develop an open standard for measuring public life in cities. The Protocol was formally published in October, 2017.

Today, we are happy to take it one step further and release the [Protocol on GitHub](https://github.com/gehl-institute/pldp) as an open source project. GitHub hosts over 91 million open source projects, including projects and data from city [governments](http://government.github.com) like those using the Protocol. By giving it home on GitHub, civic hackers, activists and city governments can use and shape the future of the Protocol. They can also find each other and knowledge can be shared—one of the ultimate goals of the Protocol.

The Protocol and its supporting documents are licensed under [Creative Commons 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.ast) and will be governed by both the Gehl Institute board and founding partners listed above. We welcome feedback and contributions to the [repository](https://github.com/gehl-institute/pldp). We’re also starting a [list of data collected using the Protocol](https://github.com/gehl-institute/pldp/blob/master/pldp-datasets.md). If you’ve created a dataset, please [add it to the list](https://github.com/gehl-institute/pldp/blob/master/pldp-datasets.md) and help grow the knowledge base.
