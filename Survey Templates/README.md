# Survey Templates

The public life tools (PDF) available here will help you measure how people use public spaces and better understand the relationship between those spaces and the public life that takes place in them. “Tried and true” tools have been a part of the way we measure for a decade or more. “Beta” tools are just getting up and running in recent years. The tools under “Unfinished” are more experimental and may not make it into our permanent collection.

Let us know what you think, open a [new issue](https://github.com/gehl-institute/pldp/issues/new) here or email us: [publiclife@gehlinstitute.org](mailto:publiclife@gehlinstitute.org).
